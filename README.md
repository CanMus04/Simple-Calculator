# Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator application built in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator can handle both integer and floating-point numbers.

## About the Project

At first glance, creating a basic calculator seemed like an easy task, but it turned out to be more challenging than expected. The hardest part was handling user input and managing errors gracefully, such as ensuring that the program doesn't crash when invalid data is entered or when a division by zero occurs. Organizing the code to make it both functional and easy to follow also took more effort than I initially thought.

I used tutorials and resources from the web, and when I encountered bugs or wasn't sure about certain concepts, I turned to ChatGPT for help. Debugging the application and refining the user experience was a rewarding process that helped me improve my coding skills.

### Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles both integer and floating-point numbers.
- Graceful error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero.
- Simple, user-friendly command-line interface.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
2. The user enters two numbers.
3. The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.
4. The user can choose to perform another calculation or exit the application by entering 'q'.
